    lans for a remake of 1994's The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following 
    box office successes for Disney remakes such as The Jungle Book (2016), which was also 
    directed by Favreau. <div>was inspired by certain roles</div>  of characters in the Broadway 
    adaptation, and developed upon elements of the original film's story. 
    <p>Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen 
        stage in Los Angeles. The "virtual-reality tools" utilized in The Jungle Book's 
        cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of The Lion King. Composers 
        Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice, all of whom worked on the original's 
        soundtrack, returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in 
        the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled "Spirit", 
        which she also performed.

    <p>The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi, 
        and it is dedicated to his memory. With an estimated budget of around $260 million, it 
        is one of the most expensive films ever made.
